We've reached an important milestone: real-time group chat between users on different machines, communicating through the Freenet network with sub-second message latency. The screenshot above captures the first live conversation—no servers, no federation, just peers.

#### A Proof of Concept

[River](https://github.com/freenet/river) is our test application for Freenet's core capabilities. It's very much a work in progress and not yet ready for general use, but it validates what we've been building toward: fully decentralized, scalable applications that feel responsive enough for real-time interaction.

#### Why This Matters

Freenet is designed to make general-purpose decentralized applications practical. Unlike federated systems that still rely on servers, Freenet applications have no central infrastructure—data propagates through the peer-to-peer network. River is the first demonstration of this working end-to-end with real users.

We'll share more as the platform matures.
