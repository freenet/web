With personal data commoditized by big tech, ghost keys are a way to maintain anonymity while tackling serious problems like bots and spam.
Here&amp;rsquo;s how it works: when you make a donation to Freenet, your web browser generates a public-private key pair. The public key is then encrypted, or blinded, and sent to our server. The server signs this blinded key and sends it back to your browser, which decrypts the signature, creating a cryptographic certificate that is signed by the server without the server ever seeing it.</description></item></channel></rss>
