The goal is to make it easier to isolate bugs by separating the connection handling logic from the transport layer so they can be tested independently.
What&amp;rsquo;s Changing:
Decoupling Connection Handling: We’re separating the connection handling code from the transport layer. This change allows us to test connection states on their own, without involving the transport mechanisms.</description></item><item><title>Weekly Dev Meeting - Gateway deployment, freenet-chat</title><link>https://freenet.org/news/1127-weekly-dev-meeting-gateway-deployment-freenet-chat/</link><pubDate>Mon, 10 Jun 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://freenet.org/news/1127-weekly-dev-meeting-gateway-deployment-freenet-chat/</guid><description>Freenet Chat Development:
Ian has been working on the Freenet chat system and shared a specification document. He decided to focus on a web-based interface rather than a command-line interface due to ease of implementation. A significant topic was the method for updating contracts within the network. Ian proposed a replace contract field that allows for contract updates signed by the contract owner, similar to HTTP 301 redirects. Technical Challenges and Solutions:</description></item><item><title>Weekly Dev Meeting - Enhancing Connection Stability and Finalizing Transport Fixes</title><link>https://freenet.org/news/1097-weekly-dev-meeting-enhancing-connection-stability-and-finalizing-transport-fixes/</link><pubDate>Fri, 24 May 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://freenet.org/news/1097-weekly-dev-meeting-enhancing-connection-stability-and-finalizing-transport-fixes/</guid><description>Focus on Connection Stability and Transport Improvements
Our primary focus has been on enhancing the stability and functionality of the connection and transport layers within Freenet. Ignacio has dedicated significant effort to address issues related to the connect operation and transport mechanisms. We’ve identified and resolved several bugs, ensuring that connections are maintained properly and cleaned up when lost. Although we haven’t fully tested all scenarios, the connect operation is now functioning as expected.</description></item><item><title>Weekly dev meeting - network integration testing and squashing final bugs</title><link>https://freenet.org/news/1081-weekly-dev-meeting-network-integration-testing-and-squashing-final-bugs/</link><pubDate>Sat, 11 May 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://freenet.org/news/1081-weekly-dev-meeting-network-integration-testing-and-squashing-final-bugs/</guid><description>In our latest dev meeting, we dove into the recent updates and challenges with the Freenet network protocol. Ignacio shared the latest on our efforts to boost node connectivity and stability across the network.
What’s New: Stability and Bug Fixes: We spent a good chunk of this week squashing bugs to make network connections more stable. Ignacio explained the technical hurdles we’re tackling to keep connections between nodes reliable. It’s tricky but we&amp;rsquo;re making headway.</description></item><item><title>Weekly dev meeting - progressing Towards Network Stability</title><link>https://freenet.org/news/1074-weekly-dev-meeting-progressing-towards-network-stability/</link><pubDate>Fri, 03 May 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://freenet.org/news/1074-weekly-dev-meeting-progressing-towards-network-stability/</guid><description>Summary: In this week&amp;rsquo;s Freenet developer meeting, Ian Clarke and Ignacio Duart discussed significant advancements and remaining challenges before getting the network up and running. The primary focus was on refining the connection and configuration processes within Freenet&amp;rsquo;s system. Key highlights include:
Configuration Management: The developers have implemented a system to set and save default configurations, which are crucial for initializing and maintaining stable operations after restarts. The configuration files are currently managed using TOML due to its robust support in Rust.</description></item><item><title>Weekly Developer Meeting: Updating State and Performance Optimizations</title><link>https://freenet.org/news/900-weekly-developer-meeting-updating-state-and-performance-optimizations/</link><pubDate>Wed, 22 Nov 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://freenet.org/news/900-weekly-developer-meeting-updating-state-and-performance-optimizations/</guid><description>We had a detailed technical discussion focusing on various aspects of our project, Freenet. Here&amp;rsquo;s a breakdown of the key points:
Contract Update Mechanism: We tackled the contract update mechanism, crucial for handling the state (the associated data) of contracts in our key-value store. This involves understanding how updates are initiated by applications, the merging of states, and the process of sending updates to subscribers.
Update and Merge Process: We discussed the specifics of how updates work, particularly focusing on the &amp;lsquo;put&amp;rsquo; operation.</description></item></channel></rss>
