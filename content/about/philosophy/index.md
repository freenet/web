They used to say the Internet routes around censorship. 

They don't say this anymore.  That was the promise that came with the origins of the Internet in 1969, inspired by research into networks that could survive severe disruption, as for example, a nuclear attack. The advent of the world wide web allowed the Internet to break out of the universities into the mainstream in the 1990s, reaching almost two billion users by 2000.

### The Rise of Centralization
 
By 2010, the Internet had shifted dramatically.  A handful of colossal tech companies dominated, operating centralized services that controlled vast swaths of our digital lives. Despite gaining significant power, most of these companies were initially influenced by their founders' belief in free speech.
Paradise Lost
 
The mid-2010s brought a tide of political turbulence perceived as existential threats by these tech giants. In response, they shifted from platforms of free expression to gatekeepers of permissible speech. This shift has had profound and personal consequences; opaque algorithms intensified division and polarization, undermining the mental health of an entire generation.  Moreover, the silencing of dissenting voices created an environment even more oppressive than the McCarthyism era of the 1950s.  This, sadly, is the state of the internet in 2024. 
 
### Hope On the Horizon
 
Enter Freenet – a decentralized network developed to revive the original promise of the Internet – a robust space for free, unrestrained communication.  Freenet is a necessary alternative to the increasing centralization and censorship that threatens our fundamental freedoms.
 
Our core principle? If two or more people wish to communicate consensually, they should be free to do so without interference by government or other powerful interests.

Freenet prioritizes privacy and security; by distributing data across a global network without relying on centralized servers, we effectively route around censorship and resist attempts at control. This design allows individuals to share information, ideas, and content without fear of suppression.  We believe democracy requires this.  
 
Furthermore, we see the digital world today placing far too much of our personal data in the hands of Big Tech and beyond our control. Freenet provides a technological alternative. We empower you, the user, to create and interact with applications that respect your autonomy and sovereignty. This self-sovereign model of the Internet encourages an environment where innovation can thrive, free from the opportunistic practices of corporate gatekeepers.

### Freedom of Speech

Freenet is dedicated to preserving the fundamental right to freedom of speech, ensuring individuals can communicate without fear of censorship.  Through its entirely decentralized architecture, Freenet eliminates single points of control, making it resistant to suppression by any entity.  We believe that true democracy and societal progress are unattainable without the unrestricted exchange of ideas.  Today, Big Tech often dictates the boundaries of acceptable discourse;  Freenet offers a refreshing and urgently needed alternative.

### Decentralized Moderation

Centralized moderation systems are all too often unreliable, and prone to political and ideological abuse.  The original Freenet introduced a decentralized moderation method called Web of Trust, empowering individuals to control their own content and shield themselves from spam, pornography, and other unwanted material.  The new Freenet will expand this idea into a decentralized reputation system, giving users even greater control.
Paradise Regained
Our mission? To restore a truly decentralized internet, by creating a future where technology serves humanity instead of controlling it.  This sharecropping we’ve all been yoked to; this techno-feudalism we’ve all been living with?   It is time for something better.   By returning to the Internet’s foundational principles, we are chasing the promise of a truly sovereign technological future.  A world where we, as individuals, regain control over our digital lives, where we can rely on an unassailable right to freedom of speech, and the protection of our personal data from exploitation and commodification. 

Welcome to Freenet.
