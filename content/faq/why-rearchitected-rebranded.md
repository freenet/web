# Why was Freenet rearchitected and rebranded?

In 2019, Ian began developing a successor to the original Freenet,
internally named \"Locutus.\" This redesign was a ground-up reimagining,
incorporating lessons learned from the original Freenet and addressing
modern challenges. The original Freenet, although groundbreaking, was
built for an earlier era.

This isn\'t the first time Freenet has undergone significant changes.
Around 2005, we transitioned from version 0.5 to 0.7, which was a
complete rewrite introducing \"friend-to-friend\" networking.

In March 2023, the original Freenet (developed from 2005 onwards) was
spun off into an independent project called \"Hyphanet\" under its
existing maintainers. Concurrently, \"Locutus\" was rebranded as
\"Freenet,\" also known as \"Freenet 2023,\" to signal this new
direction and focus. The rearchitected Freenet is faster, more flexible,
and better equipped to offer a robust, decentralized alternative to the
increasingly centralized web.

It is important to note that the maintainers of the original Freenet did
not agree with the decision to rearchitect and rebrand. However, as the
architect of the Freenet Project, and after over a year of debate, Ian
felt this was the necessary path forward to ensure the project\'s
continued relevance and success in a world very different than when he
designed the previous architecture.
