# How do the previous and current versions of Freenet differ?

The previous and current versions of Freenet have several key
differences:

-   Functionality: The previous version was analogous to a decentralized
    hard drive, while the current version is analogous to a full
    decentralized computer.

-   Real-time Interaction: The current version allows users to subscribe
    to data and be notified immediately if it changes. This is essential
    for systems like instant messaging or group chat.

-   Programming Language: Unlike the previous version, which was
    developed in Java, the current Freenet is implemented in Rust. This
    allows for better efficiency and integration into a wide variety of
    platforms (Windows, Mac, Android, MacOS, etc).

-   Transparency: The current version is a drop-in replacement for the
    world wide web and is just as easy to use.

-   Anonymity: While the previous version was designed with a focus on
    anonymity, the current version does not offer built-in anonymity but
    allows for a choice of anonymizing systems to be layered on top.
