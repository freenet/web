# What is the project's history?

Freenet was initially developed by Ian Clarke at the University of
Edinburgh in 1999 as a decentralized system for information storage and
retrieval, offering users the ability to publish or retrieve information
anonymously.

In 2019, Ian began work on a successor to the original Freenet, which
was internally known as \"Locutus.\" This project, a redesign from the
ground up, incorporated lessons learned from the original Freenet\'s
development and operation, and adapted to today\'s challenges. In March
2023, the original version of Freenet was separated into its [own
project](https://www.hyphanet.org/pages/about.html), and what was known
as \"Locutus\" was officially branded as \"Freenet.\"
