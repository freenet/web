# What are the key components of Freenet\'s architecture?

Delegates, contracts, and user interfaces (UIs) each serve distinct
roles in the Freenet ecosystem. Contracts control public data, or
\"shared state.\" Delegates act as the user\'s agent and can store
private data on the user\'s behalf, while UIs provide an interface
between these and the user through a web browser. See the [user
manual](https://docs.freenet.org/components/overview.html) for more
detail.
