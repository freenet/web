# Can anyone use Freenet?

While Freenet is designed to be accessible to most users, approximately
10-20% of users might experience connectivity issues due to being behind
symmetric NATs or restrictive firewalls. These network configurations,
often implemented by ISPs, can prevent direct peer-to-peer connections,
which are essential for Freenet\'s decentralized network. Users behind
such configurations might also face difficulties with other applications
requiring low-latency connections, such as multiplayer games and VoIP
services. We recommend choosing ISPs that offer less restrictive NAT
configurations to ensure a better overall internet experience and
seamless use of Freenet.
