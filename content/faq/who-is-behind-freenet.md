# Who is behind Freenet?

Freenet was started by Ian Clarke in 1999 and grew out of his
undergraduate
[paper](https://cs.baylor.edu/~donahoo/classes/5321/papers/C99.pdf) \"A
Distributed Decentralized Information Storage and Retrieval System.\"

To further the goals of the project, Ian Clarke and Steven Starr
co-founded The Freenet 501c3 non-profit in 2001.

In 2024, the Freenet non-profit board of directors consists of Ian
Clarke, Steven Starr, and Michael Grube, with Ian serving as President
and Steven as Chief Strategy Officer. Along with Ian, the development
team consists of Nacho Duart and Hector Alberto Santos Rodriguez.
