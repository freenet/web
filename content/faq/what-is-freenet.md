# What is Freenet?

Freenet is a fully decentralized, peer-to-peer network and a drop-in
replacement for the world wide web. It operates as a global shared
computer, providing a platform for sophisticated decentralized software
systems. Freenet allows developers to create decentralized alternatives
to centralized services, including messaging, social media, email, and
e-commerce. It\'s designed for simplicity and flexibility and can be
used seamlessly through your web browser. The platform\'s user-friendly
decentralized applications are scalable, interoperable, and secured with
cryptography.
