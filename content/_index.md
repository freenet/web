## Declare your digital independence

The centralization of the internet poses a fundamental threat to
individual freedom. In 2024, a few corporations control most internet
services and infrastructure. These corporations wield immense power over
most of us with little accountability, enabling them to censor content,
exploit our data, and exclude users from services they depend on ---all
with profound implications for democracy. We need a solution urgently.

Introducing Freenet --- a decentralized replacement for the world wide
web. Acting as a global, shared, decentralized computing platform,
Freenet can either be accessed via a standard web browser or integrated
into third-party applications.

Freenet is not merely a tool for developers; it offers a pathway for
anyone seeking greater control and freedom in their digital
interactions. You can build or use decentralized services for messaging,
social media, email, and e-commerce. These applications are designed for
scalability and interoperability, secured through modern cryptographic
techniques.

### Status (June 2024)

Freenet is nearing an initial network launch. At this stage it will
primarily be of interest to developers interested in building
decentralized systems on Freenet.
