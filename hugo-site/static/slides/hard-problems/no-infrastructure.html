    With the traditional web, deploying an app means: cloud accounts, DNS setup, SSL certificates, database configuration, API keys, and ongoing monthly costs.

    With Freenet: you deploy a contract. The hash of your code becomes its address. That's it.

    The network handles replication, availability, and scaling automatically.
    No DevOps. No infrastructure bills. No 3am pager alerts.

    This is what makes Freenet viable for AI agents - they can deploy services without needing AWS accounts or credit cards.
