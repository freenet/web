    Every Freenet app has three components:

    1. CONTRACT - Runs on the network, stores shared state. Think of it as your "database" but replicated across peers. Anyone can read it, but updates must follow the contract's rules.

    2. DELEGATE - Runs locally on the user's device. This is the "trust zone" - it holds private keys, does signing and encryption. Your secrets never leave your hardware.

    3. UI - Standard web app. React, Vue, whatever you want. Connects to the local Freenet node via HTTP/WebSocket. Talks to contracts for shared data, delegates for private operations.

    River implements exactly this pattern - contract for chat rooms, delegate for user identity, standard web UI.
