    On the left is the traditional web stack - TCP/IP, HTTP talking to centralized servers that store your data.
    On the right is Freenet - we share IP as the foundation, use UDP for peer communication, but HTTP for the familiar browser interface.
    Instead of centralized servers, it's a P2P network of equal peers.
    And critically - your private data stays on YOUR hardware in delegates, not on someone else's servers.
