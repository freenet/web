Freenet is a peer‑to‑peer network that replaces the client‑server structure of today’s web with a mesh of equal nodes. Every computer that runs the **Freenet Core** stores and serves data, so no single party can block, censor, or monetise access.

The Core is a compact binary, under 5 MB, and installs in seconds on desktop, mobile, or embedded hardware. Once launched it finds nearby peers and self‑organises into a small‑world overlay that routes requests efficiently without any central directory.

On this foundation you can build websites, group chat, marketplaces, or any real‑time app. A browser points to your local node, downloads the app code, and interacts with other Freenet apps through WebSocket APIs—no external servers, accounts, or tracking.
