### Declare Your Digital Independence

The centralization of the internet poses a fundamental threat to individual
freedom. In 2024, a few corporations control most online services and
infrastructure, wielding immense power with little accountability. They can
censor content, exploit data, and exclude users from essential services,
undermining democracy. We need a solution urgently.

Introducing Freenetâ€”a decentralized replacement for the World Wide Web. Acting
as a global, shared computing platform, Freenet can be accessed via a standard
web browser or seamlessly integrated into third-party applications like games.

Freenet brings the potential for new solutions to old problems like spam,
[DDoS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denial-of-service_attack), keeping private
data private, and much more.

Freenet is flexible enough to build entirely decentralized alternatives to
existing centralized services, such as messaging, social media, email, and
e-commerce. Every component of every service built on Freenet is interoperable
by default, ensuring seamless integration and interaction across the platform.
Services are also scalable by default and secured through modern cryptographic
techniques, keeping control in the hands of users, not tech oligarchs.

#### Status (25th June 2024)

Freenet is nearing an initial network launch as we track down some final bugs. 
At this stage it will primarily be of interest to developers interested in
building decentralized systems on Freenet.
