Freenet is the internet as it should be—fully decentralized, designed to put you back in control.
Imagine a global shared computer where you can communicate and collaborate freely, without reliance
on big tech. Freenet lets you regain your digital independence.

Freenet is a peer-to-peer network that transforms users’ computers into a resilient, distributed
platform on which anyone can build decentralized services. Every peer contributes to a
fault-tolerant collective, ensuring services are always available and robust.

Today's web is a series of siloed services, but every system built on Freenet is fully interoperable
by default. Freenet apps can be built with popular web frameworks, accessed through any browser just
like the web.
