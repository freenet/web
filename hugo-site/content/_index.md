Freenet is the internet as it should have been—fully decentralized, designed to put you back in
control. Imagine a global shared computer where you can communicate and collaborate freely, without
reliance on big tech. Freenet lets you regain your digital independence.

Freenet is a peer-to-peer network that transforms users’ computers into a resilient, distributed
platform on which anyone can build decentralized services. Every peer contributes to a
fault-tolerant collective, ensuring services are always available and robust.

The web is a series of siloed services, but every system built on Freenet is fully interoperable by
default. We haven't reinvented wheels unnecessarily, apps can be built with popular existing web
frameworks and are accessed through any web browser.
