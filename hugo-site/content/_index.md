### Declare Your Digital Independence

The centralization of the internet poses a fundamental threat to individual
freedom. In 2024, a few corporations control most internet services and
infrastructure. These corporations wield immense power with little
accountability, enabling them to censor content, exploit our data, and exclude
users from essential services—all with profound implications for individual 
liberty and democracy. The need for a solution is urgent.

Introducing Freenet—a decentralized replacement for the World Wide Web. Acting
as a global, shared computing platform, Freenet can be accessed via a standard
web browser or integrated into third-party applications.

Freenet is flexible enough to build entirely decentralized alternatives to
existing centralized services, such as messaging, social media, email, and
e-commerce. All services built on Freenet are interoperable, scalable by
default, and secured through modern cryptographic techniques.

#### Status (June 2024)

Freenet is nearing an initial network launch. At this stage it will primarily be
of interest to developers interested in building decentralized systems on
Freenet.
