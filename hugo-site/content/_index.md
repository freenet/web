Freenet is a peer-to-peer platform for decentralized applications—communication, collaboration, and
commerce without reliance on big tech. Your computer becomes part of a global network where apps
are unstoppable, interoperable, and built on open protocols.

### For Users

don't track you, and work without any company behind them.
