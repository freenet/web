## What is a Ghost Key?

A Ghost Key is a cryptographic proof of your donation that maintains your anonymity. It allows you to demonstrate your support for Freenet without compromising your privacy. This aligns with Freenet's core principles of protecting user identity and promoting free speech.

## What's Next?

Once your Ghost Key certificate is generated, you'll be able to download it. This certificate can be used to prove your donation status within the Freenet network, potentially unlocking certain features or privileges, all while keeping your identity concealed.

Remember to save your Ghost Key certificate in a secure location. It's your private proof of donation and cannot be replaced if lost.
