When you make a donation to Freenet, your browser creates a special digital key that is then encrypted and sent to 
our server. We sign this encrypted key to certify your donation without ever seeing your actual key. This ensures 
that your anonymity is maintained and prevents any connection between your donation and the key. The signed key, 
your "Ghost Credential," can be used to help manage your messages and build a reputation in our community, 
all while keeping your privacy intact.
