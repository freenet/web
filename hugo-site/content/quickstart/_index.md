**Alpha Software:** Freenet is under active development and may be unstable. New versions are released frequently—sometimes multiple times per day—and older versions will stop working as the network evolves.

During alpha testing:
- **Telemetry:** Your peer will report diagnostic data to our servers for debugging purposes, including peer activity and general system info (e.g., your OS).
- **Auto-updates:** Your peer may automatically update when new versions become available.
