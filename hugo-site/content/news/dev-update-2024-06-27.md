For the past two weeks we've been [working](https://github.com/freenet/freenet-core/pull/1131) on 
a refactor of part of the transport code to address a bug that would have negatively impacted the 
user experience by preventing peers from connecting to each other.

Once the refactor is complete and the bug is fixed, we should be ready to release the next 
version and start testing the network with a larger group of users.
