Eventual convergence is a fundamental concept in distributed systems that describes how a network of nodes gradually reaches a consistent state over time. In this article, we'll explore how information spreads through a network and how nodes eventually agree on shared data.

### Visualizing Information Propagation

The following interactive visualization demonstrates how updates propagate through a network. Each node starts with the same initial state (color). When you click on a node, it receives new information (a new color) which then spreads to its neighbors:

Click different nodes to see how information spreads through the network. Notice how:
- Updates propagate gradually from node to node
- Multiple updates can spread simultaneously
- The network eventually reaches a consistent state
- Each node maintains a history of updates it has received

More detailed explanations and additional visualizations coming soon...
