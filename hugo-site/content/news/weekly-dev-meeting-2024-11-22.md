### Freenet Weekly Development Update - November 22, 2024

**This Week's Progress**  
We focused on stabilizing network operations after recent updates. Most major issues have been
resolved, but a key challenge remains with the WebSocket API:

1. **WebSocket Connection Stability**:

   - **Issue**: WebSocket connections occasionally drop, particularly during contract updates. This
     may be due to the lack of a keep-alive mechanism or another issue with how the client handles
     connections.
   - **Next Steps**: Investigating whether periodic ping messages can prevent these disconnections.
     The application and node will also be tested to ensure they handle connections robustly.

2. **Remaining Bugs**:
   - The network's core functions (e.g., `put` and `get` operations) are stable. However, the issue
     with updates over WebSocket connections persists.
   - A user-reported bug related to the `Clap` argument parser in the CLI is under review.

**Working on**
- 
- Investigating the WebSocket disconnection issue
- Continued work on integrating River with the websocket API

**Looking Ahead**  
We are close to resolving the final issues, which will enable a fully functional and stable network.
Testing efforts continue, with fixes expected over the weekend.

Stay tuned for more updates as we approach a significant milestone in Freenet's development!
