Small world networks are a fascinating type of network structure that appears naturally in many real-world systems - from social networks to the internet's topology. In this interactive post, we'll explore how these networks work and why they're so efficient at routing information.

## What Makes a Network "Small World"?

A small world network has a unique property: most nodes are not directly connected, but can reach each other through a surprisingly small number of steps. This is achieved through a specific pattern of connections:

1. Many short-range connections between nearby nodes
2. A few long-range connections that act as shortcuts

The visualization below shows this pattern. The nodes are arranged in a circle, with connections colored based on their length. Notice how the link distribution follows a specific pattern:

## Greedy Routing in Small World Networks

One of the most interesting properties of small world networks is how efficiently they can route messages using only local information. At each step, a node simply passes the message to its neighbor that's closest to the final destination. This "greedy" strategy works remarkably well:

## How Do Small World Networks Scale?

As we add more nodes to a small world network, how does the average path length between nodes grow? The visualization below shows this relationship:

The remarkable thing about small world networks is that the average path length grows logarithmically with the network size. This means that even in very large networks, most nodes can reach each other in relatively few steps.

This property helps explain why the "six degrees of separation" phenomenon works in social networks, and why the internet can route packets efficiently despite its enormous size.
