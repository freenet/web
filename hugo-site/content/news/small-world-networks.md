Small world networks are a fascinating type of network structure that combines the best properties of both regular networks (where nodes connect to their nearest neighbors) and random networks (which have short average path lengths). These networks are ubiquitous in nature and technology - from social networks and neural pathways to the internet's backbone.

Let's explore these remarkable networks through interactive visualizations that demonstrate their key properties.

## Link Distribution

First, let's examine the distribution of connections in a small world network. The visualization below shows how connections are primarily short-range (between nearby nodes), with strategically placed long-range connections that create "shortcuts" through the network:

{{< small-world-dist >}}

The histogram on the right quantifies this distribution - showing a high concentration of short-range links that rapidly falls off for longer distances. This characteristic pattern is what gives small world networks their efficient routing properties while maintaining local clustering.

## Greedy Routing

One key feature of small world networks is that they support efficient "greedy" routing - where messages are passed to whichever neighbor is closest to the final destination:

{{< small-world-routing >}}

Watch as messages navigate through the network using only local information. While this greedy routing strategy isn't guaranteed to find the mathematically shortest path, it demonstrates how local decisions can achieve remarkably efficient global routing - a key feature of small world networks.

## Network Scaling

Finally, let's look at how these networks scale. As we add more nodes, how does the average path length grow?

{{< small-world-scale >}}

The plot reveals one of the most remarkable properties of small world networks - the average path length grows logarithmically with network size, much slower than the linear growth seen in regular networks. This "small world" property enables efficient communication even as networks scale to millions of nodes.

This combination of mostly local connections with a few long-range links creates a highly efficient network structure that nature seems to have discovered repeatedly through evolution.
