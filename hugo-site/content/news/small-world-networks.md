Small world networks are a fascinating type of network structure that combines the benefits of regular networks (where nodes connect to their nearest neighbors) with random networks (which have short average path lengths). They're found everywhere from social networks to neural networks to the internet itself.

Let's explore how they work through some interactive visualizations.

## Link Distribution

First, let's look at how connections are distributed in a small world network. Notice how most connections are short-range (between nearby nodes), with fewer long-range connections:

{{< small-world-dist >}}

The histogram shows this distribution clearly - lots of short links, fewer long ones. This pattern is what gives small world networks their special properties.

## Greedy Routing

One key feature of small world networks is that they support efficient "greedy" routing - where messages are passed to whichever neighbor is closest to the final destination:

{{< small-world-routing >}}

Watch as messages find their way through the network. The greedy algorithm isn't guaranteed to find the absolute shortest path, but it usually finds a good one.

## Network Scaling

Finally, let's look at how these networks scale. As we add more nodes, how does the average path length grow?

{{< small-world-scale >}}

The plot shows that average path length grows very slowly with network size - much slower than in regular networks. This "small world" property is what makes these networks so efficient for communication and information spreading.

This combination of mostly local connections with a few long-range links creates a highly efficient network structure that nature seems to have discovered repeatedly through evolution.
