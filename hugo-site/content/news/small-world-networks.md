Small world networks are a fascinating type of network structure that combines the best properties of both regular networks (where nodes connect to their nearest neighbors) and random networks (which have short average path lengths). These networks are ubiquitous in nature and technology - from social networks and neural pathways to the internet's backbone.

Let's explore these remarkable networks through interactive visualizations that demonstrate their key properties.

## Greedy Routing

One key feature of small world networks is that they support efficient "greedy" routing - where messages are passed to whichever neighbor is closest to the final destination:

Watch as messages navigate through the network using only local information. While this greedy routing strategy isn't guaranteed to find the mathematically shortest path, it demonstrates how local decisions can achieve remarkably efficient global routing - a key feature of small world networks.

## Routing Performance

The real power of small world networks becomes apparent when we compare their routing performance to random networks. In the visualization below, watch as both networks attempt to route messages between random pairs of nodes:

The small world network (left) consistently achieves higher routing success rates compared to the random network (right), even though both have the same number of connections. This is because the small world network's strategic mix of short and long-range connections creates natural routing pathways that span the entire network efficiently.

A routing attempt is considered successful if it reaches its destination within 30 hops. Notice how the small world network's structured randomness leads to more reliable message delivery, while the purely random network often requires more hops or fails to find paths entirely.

## Network Scaling

Finally, let's look at how these networks scale. As we add more nodes, how does the average path length grow?

{{< small-world-scale >}}

The plot reveals one of the most remarkable properties of small world networks - the average path length grows logarithmically with network size, much slower than the linear growth seen in regular networks. This "small world" property enables efficient communication even as networks scale to millions of nodes.

This combination of mostly local connections with a few long-range links creates a highly efficient network structure that nature seems to have discovered repeatedly through evolution.
