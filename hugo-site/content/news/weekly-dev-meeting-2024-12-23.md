This week’s developer meeting highlighted steady progress toward Freenet’s upcoming release. Key
milestones include successful testing of peer-to-peer connections, including hole-punching, which
allows nodes to communicate seamlessly across firewalls. This feature is critical for maintaining
decentralized connectivity and performed well during tests.

The team has implemented an automated configuration system, enabling nodes to download gateway
settings directly, streamlining the setup process. Ignacio and Hector demonstrated scripts for
quickly setting up nodes and gateways, simplifying deployment for developers and testers. Once
released, most users will be able to get started with a single `cargo install` command.

Discussions also focused on preparing for larger-scale testing, including automated updates and
precompiled binaries for multiple platforms. Future plans include refining error handling, improving
network reliability, and finalizing features like contract updates and streaming support.

The team is preparing a short demo video to showcase the network in action and looks forward to
gathering feedback as testing expands. Freenet continues to move closer to release, and we’re
excited to share more updates soon!
