title = "Weekly Dev Meeting - Refactoring Connection Handler for Better Unit Testing" 
date = 2024-07-05
+++

This week we've been focussed on a crucial refactoring task to improve how we manage
network connections. The goal is to make it easier to isolate bugs by separating the
connection handling logic from the transport layer so they can be tested independently.

**What's Changing:**

1. **Decoupling Connection Handling:**
  - We’re separating the connection handling code from the transport layer. This
    change allows us to test connection states on their own, without involving
    the transport mechanisms.
  - With this separation, we can emulate connections and test different states
    more accurately, pinpointing problems faster.

2. **Enhanced Testing and Debugging:**
  - By isolating the connection handling, Nacho has created a series of unit
    tests to cover various connection scenarios, such as establishing,
    rejecting, and accepting connections.
  - This approach helps us identify areas needing improvement and ensures our
    changes lead to a more stable system.

3. **Clearer Error Handling:**
  - The refactor also simplifies error handling. By separating concerns, it’s
    easier to see if issues come from the connection handling or the transport
    layer, making debugging more straightforward.

4. **Streamlined Codebase:**
  - We've removed redundant and tangled code, simplifying the codebase and
    reducing potential failure points.

#### Next Steps:

1. **Completing the Refactor:**
  - Nacho is close to finishing this refactor. The plan is to replace all the
    old connection handling code with the new modular implementation.
  - This change will make the system easier to maintain and test, setting us up
    well for future enhancements.

2. **Focusing on Transport Layer Issues:**
  - Once the refactor is done, we'll turn our attention to fixing any remaining
    transport layer issues. With the connection handling logic isolated,
    identifying and addressing these issues should be more manageable.
  - We'll add more unit tests for the transport layer to cover all edge cases
    and ensure it works reliably.

3. **Preparing for the Next Release:**
  - If the transport layer is stable after the refactor, we’ll move forward with
    a release. This update will include the recent improvements and ensure our
    core network functionalities are solid.

#### Conclusion

This refactor should be the last step before launching the Freenet network. By 
modularizing the connection handling, we can test more thoroughly and fix issues 
more quickly, leading to a more stable platform.
