- **Current Progress:**

  - Significant cleanup has been done, focusing on resolving issues with the transport layer and
    dependencies.
  - Transport layer is working well, and the remaining issues are expected to be fixed within the
    next few days.
  - The handshake handler has been thoroughly tested, with only minor remaining issues that are
    actively being addressed.
  - A new monitoring and logging tool is almost ready and will be integrated soon.

- **Next Steps:**

  - Larger network simulations will be conducted to test Freenet's behavior with more peers.
  - Live testing on a real network environment will verify peer-to-peer connectivity and hole
    punching.
  - Final testing of key contracts (e.g., microblogging, mailing) is planned to ensure they work
    correctly, though some may be revisited after the initial release.

- **Release Timing:**

  - The release is tentatively expected within the next few weeks, but this depends on the success
    of network simulations and live testing.
  - A cautious approach is being taken to minimize risks in real-world conditions, with connectivity
    between non-gateway peers being the highest area of concern.

- **Technical Highlights:**
  - WebAssembly has been used to maintain a highly responsive user interface, which is key for the
    user experience despite being a decentralized app.
  - Ongoing work on improving the invite process for chat rooms includes exploring solutions like
    cryptographic proof-of-work and Ghost Keys to prevent abuse.
  - Message encryption and archiving mechanisms have been discussed but may be added post-MVP to
    simplify the initial release.
