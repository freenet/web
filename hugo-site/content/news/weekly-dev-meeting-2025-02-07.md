### **Freenet Sync Meeting Summary â€“ Ian Clarke & Ignacio Duart (2025/02/07 08:45 CST)**  

#### **Attendees**  
- Ian Clarke  
- Ignacio Duart  

#### **Key Updates & Discussion Points**  

1. **Network Connection Fixes**  
   - Most issues preventing stable peer connections have been fixed.  
   - The network can now maintain multiple connections, resolving a previous issue where only two peers could connect at a time.  
   - The root cause was a combination of:  
     - The gateway not waiting long enough before cleaning transient connections.  
     - A logic bug in packet receipt handling that caused repeated transmission loops.  
   - A fix was implemented to send receipts after a time threshold, even if the packet count limit wasn't met.  

2. **Remaining Network Issue**  
   - There is still a logical issue in peer filtering when forwarding new connection requests.  
   - Some peers are mistakenly being filtered out, preventing them from establishing connections.  
   - Ignacio believes the issue stems from unintended state mutations in transaction forwarding logic.  

3. **Ping Contract Debugging**  
   - The team was testing the ping contract using a single peer for writes and others for reads.  
   - An issue was discovered where state updates are not propagating, likely caused by a previous efficiency optimization that prevented redundant updates.  
   - The get function may also not be retrieving the contract correctly.  

4. **Demo & Deliverable Strategy for Filecoin**  
   - Filecoin's representative likely just needs documentation proving progress rather than a live demo.  
   - The plan is to:  
     - Ensure a version is published that users can install.  
     - Demonstrate the ping contract working via a recorded video rather than a live presentation.  
   - Aiming to send materials by **Friday, February 14**, avoiding a last-minute submission.  

5. **Persistent Contract Updates for Demo**  
   - To ensure the contract is continuously updated, the team will run the ping contract on a gateway to keep activity visible.  

6. **Code & Technical Adjustments**  
   - Discussed removing an outdated connection filtering rule preventing multiple nodes on the same local network from connecting.  
   - Ensured that the network can support multiple peers with the same location, using historical response times for routing decisions.  

7. **River Chat Integration & Serialization Issue**  
   - Ian is working on integrating River with Freenet.  
   - Encountering a serialization error when sending messages via WebSockets.  
   - Ignacio suggested debugging the contract execution process by adding logging inside the contract functions.  
   - Suspected issue: The contract is failing to deserialize state data inside the WASM execution layer.  

#### **Next Steps**  
- **Ignacio** will continue debugging the contract issue and monitor network stability over the weekend.  
- **Ian** will investigate the serialization error in River and implement contract logging to pinpoint the deserialization issue.  
- **Both** will work toward a stable release early next week, with a recorded demo prepared by midweek.  

#### **Closing Notes**  
- Ignacio mentioned a tool for creating realistic AI-generated demo videos with avatars; he will follow up with Ian on its name.  
- Ignacio had to leave for family obligations, and the meeting concluded at **00:56:00**.
